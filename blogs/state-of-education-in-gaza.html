	<h2 id="-introduction-"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
	<p>The Gaza Strip, a densely populated coastal enclave, faces significant challenges in its education system. Ongoing
		conflicts, economic hardships, and political instability have deeply impacted the lives of students and educators.
		In this article, we delve into the state of education in Gaza, highlighting both the struggles and the resilience of
		its educational community.</p>
	<h2 id="-unrwa-s-role-in-education-"><strong>UNRWA&#39;s Role in Education</strong></h2>
	<p>The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) plays a crucial role in
		providing education to Palestinian children in Gaza. As of the 2021/2022 school year, UNRWA serves <strong>291,100
			students</strong> (150,608 males and 140,492 females) across <strong>183 schools</strong> in the Gaza Strip. These
		schools operate under challenging conditions, with class sizes averaging <strong>41.2 students</strong> per class¹.
	</p>
	<h2 id="-challenges-faced-by-students-"><strong>Challenges Faced by Students</strong></h2>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Psychological Trauma</strong>: Recurrent hostilities, including conflicts in 2008/09, 2012/14, and 2021,
			have left lasting scars on Gaza&#39;s children. The May 2021 incident resulted in the loss of lives and injuries,
			affecting the emotional well-being of students. A survey found that <strong>42% of children</strong> needed
			psychosocial intervention, even <strong>nine months later</strong>, with <strong>35% still experiencing trauma
				reactions</strong>¹.</li>
		<li><strong>Economic Hardships</strong>: The dire economic situation exacerbates the risk of student dropouts. Some
			families struggle to afford school materials or transportation costs. Boys often feel pressured to contribute to
			family income, impacting their ability to attend school regularly.</li>
		<li><strong>Blockade and Restricted Movement</strong>: Gaza&#39;s ongoing blockade, now in its fifteenth year,
			severely restricts freedom of movement, cripples the economy, and leaves many dependent on humanitarian aid.
			Students face challenges in accessing educational resources and opportunities.</li>
	</ol>
	<h2 id="-impact-on-school-infrastructure-"><strong>Impact on School Infrastructure</strong></h2>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Emergency Shelters</strong>: During conflicts, <strong>90% of school buildings</strong> in Gaza serve as
			emergency shelters for internally displaced persons. This dual use disrupts regular schooling, affecting
			<strong>400,700 students</strong>².</li>
		<li><strong>School Damage</strong>: Since October 7, <strong>342 schools</strong> have been damaged, with
			<strong>eight completely destroyed</strong>². The destruction of educational infrastructure hampers learning and
			stability.</li>
	</ol>
	<h2 id="-education-reform-and-resilience-"><strong>Education Reform and Resilience</strong></h2>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Teacher Development</strong>: UNRWA has implemented the Teacher Policy, focusing on professional
			development. School-based teacher programs allow educators to experiment with new approaches in the classroom.
		</li>
		<li><strong>Child-Centered Approach</strong>: Despite challenges, schools remain places where students feel safe and
			secure. Mental health and psychosocial support services are essential for addressing trauma and promoting
			well-being.</li>
		<li><strong>Advocacy for Children&#39;s Rights</strong>: UNRWA advocates for the rights of children, emphasizing
			protection from violence and the importance of education.</li>
	</ol>
	<h2 id="-conclusion-"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
	<p>Education in Gaza faces immense hurdles, but the resilience of students, teachers, and the UNRWA community shines
		through. As we continue to address these challenges, let us recognize the power of education to transform lives and
		build hope for a better future.</p>
