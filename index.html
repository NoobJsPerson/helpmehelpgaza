	<h1>FAQ</h1>
	<h3>• Why does it say that the website is not secure?</h3>
	<p>We are hosting this website on Github Pages. It has an issue with providing HTTPS for custom domains, so this website defaults to HTTP which your browser may flag as insecure. But don't worry! this page is only a static page and there is no custom code that runs except for the ads. You could verify that by yourself by looking at the source code by pressing F12 or by viewing it on the <a href="https://github.com/NoobJsPerson/helpmehelpgaza">Github page</a></p>
	<h3>• I have an issue using the website or I have a suggestion, where can I submit those?</h3>
	<p>You could report issues or post suggestions in the <a href="https://github.com/NoobJsPerson/helpmehelpgaza/issues">Github issues page</a> and we will look into as soon as we can</p>
